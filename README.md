# Udacity Nano Degree Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres

### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Goal
The project aims to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. The project involves creating a database schema and ETL pipeline and will be tested by running queries provided by the analytics team from Sparkify.

## Python Scripts
- create_tables.py: Drops and creates tables.
- sql_queries.py: Create Table, Insert, and Select SQL statements for ETL.
- etl.py: Reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into database tables.

## Database Schema

[dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5e0100dbedf08a25543f5ca7)

### Fact Table
- songplays: records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong

### Dimension Tables
- users: users in the app
- songs: songs in music database
- artists: artists in music database
- time: timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units


## ETL Pipeline

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```json
{
  "num_songs": 1,
  "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
  "artist_latitude": null,
  "artist_longitude": null,
  "artist_location": "",
  "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
  "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
  "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
  "duration": 152.92036,
  "year": 0
}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
`
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
`

And below is an example of what a single line of data in a log file, 2018-11-22-events.json, looks like.
```json
{
  "artist": "Dee Dee Bridgewater",
  "auth": "Logged In",
  "firstName": "Lily",
  "gender": "F",
  "itemInSession": 38,
  "lastName": "Koch",
  "length": 318.64118,
  "level": "paid",
  "location": "Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI",
  "method": "PUT",
  "page": "NextSong",
  "registration": 1541048010796.0,
  "sessionId": 818,
  "song": "La Vie En Rose",
  "status": 200,
  "ts": 1542845032796,
  "userAgent": "\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/36.0.1985.125 Chrome/36.0.1985.125 Safari/537.36\"",
  "userId": "15"
}
```
